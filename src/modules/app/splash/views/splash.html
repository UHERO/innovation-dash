      Innovation is the key to regional growth and prosperity.
      To better understand Hawaii’s progress in developing a vibrant innovation based economy
      this dashboard tracks key innovation assets and outcomes, and when possible, allows for
      comparison with other states and counties. The dashboard is supported by the Hawaii Business Roundtable,
      Devleague, and the University of Hawaii.
